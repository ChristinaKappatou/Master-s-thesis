# **'Simulation of sound propagation in the atmosphere using the Parabolic Equation method and application to the prediction of wind turbine noise'**

**Abstract**
The increasing energy needs of the contemporary world have rendered renewable energy sources a condition for sustainable future. Wind energy, in particular, has turned out to be one of the most efficient and cost-effective options, the employment of which gets more widely-spread every year. However, it does not come without any environmental consequences, with noise pollution being among the most alarming ones. The present study aims for the prediction of wind turbine noise immission under neutral or stable atmospheric conditions and over flat terrain. Sound propagation is simulated by the development of a code that calculates the
solution to the Parabolic Equation, assuming a monopole point source. The solution independency of the grid density and the dimensions of the computational domain and the absorbing layer is also investigated. The method reliability is validated by comparing the results to other numerical predictions and experimental measurements. Finally, the specific case of wind turbine noise propagation is assessed by applying experimental data to the developed code. The results are compared to in-situ measurements.
